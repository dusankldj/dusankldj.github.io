		<h1>Citroën throughout history</h1>
		<p>
			The "Automobiles Citroën" manufacturing company was founded in March 
			1919 by André Citroën. André Citroën (1878–1935) built armaments for 
			France during World War I; after the war, however, he realized that 
			unless he planned ahead he would have a modern factory without a product.
			Citroën was already experienced in the automotive business, thanks to a 
			successful six-year stint working with Mors between 1908 and the outbreak of war.
			The decision to switch to automobile manufacturing was taken as early as 1916, 
			which is the year when Citroën asked the engineer Louis Dufresne, previously with Panhard, 
			to design a technically-sophisticated 18HP automobile he could produce in his factory once
			peace returned. Long before that happened, however, he had modified his vision and decided, 
			like Henry Ford, that the best post-war opportunities in auto-making would involve a lighter 
			car of good quality, but made in sufficient quantities to be priced enticingly.
			In February 1917 Citroën contacted another engineer, Jules Salomon, who already had a 
			considerable reputation within the French automotive sector as the creator, in 1909, 
			of a little car called Le Zèbre. André Citroën's mandate was characteristically demanding and characteristically 
			simple: to produce an all-new design for a 10 HP car that would be better equipped, more robust and less 
			costly to produce than any rival product at the time.

				<h1>2CV</h1>
				<p>
					Between 1948 and 1990, more than 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, making it the world's first 
					front-wheel drive car to become a million seller after Citroën's own earlier model, 
					the more upscale Traction Avant, which had become the first front-wheel drive car to 
					sell in similar six-figure numbers.

					front-wheel drive car to sell in similar six-figure numbers. The 2CV platform spawned many variants, 
					as detailed in the "Production numbers" section. The 2CV and its variants are collectively known as the A-Series. 
					Notably these include the 2CV-based delivery vans known as fourgonnettes, the Ami, the Dyane, the Acadiane, and the Mehari. 
					In total, Citroën manufactured over 9 million of the 2CVs and its derivative models.

				<h1>Ds</h1>
				<p>Citroen DS is a premium executive car produced by the French automaker Citroen from 1955 to 1975.
				The DS was known for its aerodynamic design, innovative technology, 
				and hydraulic suspension system, which provided a comfortable ride. One of 
				the most popular models was the DS 21, which featured a 2.1-liter engine and 
				was nicknamed "the shark" due to its distinctive front end. The DS was also 
				famous for its appearances in films and TV shows, such as the James Bond film
				"For Your Eyes Only." Despite being produced for only 20 years, the Citroen DS remains an 
				icon of automotive design and engineering. </p>

				<h1>CX</h1>
				<p>
					he CX was launched at the 1974 Paris Motor Show. Citroën was 
					unable to schedule right-hand drive production of the car until 
					well into 1975. The CX was initially a huge success in Europe, 
					with more than 132,000 being produced in 1978. It found customers
					beyond the loyal DS customer base and used the technology of Citroën's 
					advanced grand touring personal luxury car, the SM. Unlike its principal 
					competitors, the CX did not have worldwide distribution—the cost of development
					and improvements had to be met from a geographically small sales base. According
					to Driving & Motoring Month the CX "provides a startlingly intelligent set of 
					solutions to modern motoring problems".
				</p>

				<h1>SM</h1>
				<p>
					In 1961, Citroën began work on 'Project S' – a sports 
					variant of the Citroën DS. As was customary for the firm,
					many running concept vehicles were developed, increasingly 
					complex and upmarket from the DS. Automotive journalists
					marveled at the resulting ability to travel for hours at 
					200 km/h (124 mph) in comfort In 1972 Motorsport (U.K.) 
					noted ..."that rare quality of being a nice car to be in
					at any speed, from stationary to maximum." The touring 
					range based on the SM's fuel economy and the large 90 L 
					(20 imp gal; 24 US gal) fuel tank made long, fast, 
					relaxing journeys possible.
